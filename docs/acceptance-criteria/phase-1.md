# Acceptance Criteria – Phase 1

This document defines the formal acceptance criteria for Phase 1 of the project.  
Phase 1 includes both **Initiation** (project description, requirements, interface mockup)  
and **Development** (prototype demo). These criteria apply across both milestones.  

---

## Criteria

**AC-1**: Uploading a batch of ≥10 PDFs returns summaries and clusters without application crash.  

**AC-2**: Each summary fits ≤120 words and includes objective, method, key findings, and limitations.  

**AC-3**: Cluster view shows cluster name/size and top keywords; clicking a cluster lists its papers.  

**AC-4**: A novice user can locate a known paper or a related paper in ≤3 clicks (observed in prototype).  

**AC-5**: Export (CSV/JSON) contains paper ID, summary fields, cluster ID/label.  

**AC-6**: Non-functional targets (performance, reliability, privacy) are met on demo hardware.
