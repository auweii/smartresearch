# SmartResearch â€” HTML Prototype Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots of the **initial coded HTML/CSS prototype** for the **SmartResearch** project.  
These images demonstrate the early design implementation and visual structure before backend functionality was integrated.

---

## Overview

The HTML prototype served as a **clickable design mock-up**, allowing early user testing of:
- Interface layout and responsiveness.  
- Navigation flow between upload, clustering, and summary pages.  
- Basic UI consistency with the **finalised Figma designs**.

This version was built entirely using **HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript**, without backend connection.

---

## Contents

- Screenshots capturing each key interface:
  - Upload Page  
  - All Papers Page  
  - Cluster Overview Page  
  - Summary Modal / Document Details View  
  - (Suggested) Merge Page 
Each screenshot is labeled sequentially for clarity.

---

## Notes

- The prototype reflects **frontend-only functionality**.  
- No API or clustering logic was active at this stage.  
- A **clickable version** of this prototype is available in:
  ```markdown
  /frontend/prototype
  ```
