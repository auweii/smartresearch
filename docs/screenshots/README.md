# SmartResearch — Prototype & Development Screenshots

This folder contains visual documentation for **SmartResearch**.
It showcases both the **coded HTML prototype** and the **in-progress working product** currently under development.

---

## Folder Contents

- `prototype_screenshots/` — Screenshots of the **initial HTML/CSS coded prototype**, built before full backend integration.  
- `product_screenshots/` — Screenshots of the **current working version** of SmartResearch with implemented backend functionality.  

---

## Purpose

These screenshots serve as a visual reference to demonstrate:
- The **user interface design** evolution from prototype to working product.  
- The **frontend–backend integration progress**, including implemented features and clustering outputs.  
- Visual consistency with the **finalised Figma designs** presented during the prototype phase.

---

## Notes

- Screenshots are **static** and non-interactive.  
- For those wanting a **clickable prototype**, the functional **HTML mock-up** can be accessed under: 
```markdown
/frontend/prototype
