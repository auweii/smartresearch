# Assignment 1 — Project Specification

This folder contains the deliverables for **CSIT321 Assignment 1 (Session S25-A26)**.  
It serves as the submission bundle for the *Project Specification* phase of the SmartResearch project.

## Contents
- `project_specification.pdf` — Main A1 report (Project Specification).
- `risk_register.md` — Snapshot risk register (A1 version).  
  - Full, ongoing register maintained at `/docs/risk_register.md`.

## Structure & References
- **Meeting details, agendas, and minutes** are documented in `/docs/weekly-meeting-minutes/`.  
- **Sample data** used for prototyping is available in `/data/samples/` (with `metadata.csv` manifest).  
- **Living artefacts** (e.g. working risk register, design notes) are tracked outside this folder under `/docs/`.

## Notes for Markers
- This `/docs/A1/` directory is frozen as of the A1 submission deadline.  
- Updates and ongoing project documentation will appear in the main `/docs/` tree, but will not affect the A1 deliverables.  
- References to artefacts outside this folder (e.g. `/data/samples/`, `/docs/risk_register.md`) are for context only.
